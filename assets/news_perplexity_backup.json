            "news": "Here are the key events and developments related to Super Micro Computer, Inc. (SMCI) in September 2024:\n\n## Auditor Resignation and Stock Impact\n- Ernst & Young (EY), Supermicro's auditor, resigned on October 30, but the news and its implications were highly relevant in September. EY cited that they were \"unwilling to be associated with the financial statements prepared by [Super Micro Computer's] management\" due to recent information that made them unable to rely on management's and the Audit Committee's representations. This led to a significant drop in SMCI shares, with the stock falling over 32% after the news broke[2][4].\n\n## Regulatory and Investigative Concerns\n- In September, it was reported that the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) was investigating Super Micro Computer over alleged accounting irregularities. This investigation was likely linked to an August report by Hindenburg Research, which highlighted \"glaring accounting red flags\" at Super Micro[2].\n\n## Investor Events\n- Supermicro participated in several investor events in September:\n  - Citi's 2024 Global TMT Conference on September 4, 2024, where they had a fireside chat at 8:20 am ET[1][3].\n  - Goldman Sachs Communacopia + Technology Conference on September 9, 2024, with a fireside chat at 3:05 pm PT[1][3].\n\n## Stock Performance and Delisting Risk\n- The company's stock performance continued to deteriorate, with shares down significantly from their 2024 highs. The delays in filing financial reports and the auditor's resignation increased the risk of Supermicro being delisted from the Nasdaq[4].\n\n## Corporate Actions\n- Supermicro announced a 10-for-1 stock split effective September 30, 2024, although this was a pre-planned action and not directly related to the September events[3].",

This corporate action was intended to make the shares more affordable for investors[4].\n\n## Accounting Irregularities and Federal Probe\nThe company faced allegations of accounting irregularities and potential wrongdoing, sparked by a critical report from short-seller Hindenburg Research. The U.S. Attorney's Office in San Francisco contacted individuals with potential knowledge of these matters, leading to a delay in the filing of Super Micro's annual report on Form 10-K. The company cited the need for additional time to assess its internal controls[4].\n\n## Class-Action Lawsuits\nSuper Micro was hit with three separate class-action lawsuits accusing the company of accounting irregularities, rehiring executives involved in past accounting scandals, and continuing to export products to restricted regions. These allegations led to a significant decline in the company's market capitalization[4].\n\n## Delisting Risk\nBy mid-November, Super Micro faced a real possibility of being delisted from the Nasdaq due to its failure to file the delayed 10-K annual report or submit a plan to regain compliance with the SEC. This risk was exacerbated by the lack of a public accounting firm to sign off on its financial statements after Ernst & Young resigned as its accountant in October[2].",
