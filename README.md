## Abstract

This paper introduces SOLID (Synergizing Optimization and Large Language Models for Intelligent Decision-Making), a new framework that combines the quan- titative precision of mathematical optimization with the contextual intelligence of large language models (LLMs). Inspired by the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), establishes a coordinated interaction mechanism where optimization and LLM agents iteratively align decisions through dual pricing and deviation penalties. This approach enhances decision quality, ensures modularity, and safeguards data privacy. Applications in portfolio optimization with alternative data and personalized nutrition recommendations highlight the framework’s ver- satility, with initial results demonstrating convergence and validating its ability to synergize structured and unstructured data. By uniting prescriptive modeling with generative AI capabilities, SOLID sets a new benchmark for advancing intelligent decision-making across diverse domains.
